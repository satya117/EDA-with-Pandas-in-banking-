# Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas in banking
The purpose of this project is to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in banking with Pandas framework.

## Materials and Methods
The data used for this is a subset of an open source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI ML repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html.

 I tried  answering to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:
<ol>
  <li>What is the share of clients attracted in our source data?</li>
  <li>What are the mean values ​​of numerical features among the attracted clients?</li>
  <li>What is the average call duration for the attracted clients?</li>
  <li>What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients?</li>
  <li>What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?</li>
</ol>

In addition, I made visual analysis in order to plan marketing banking campaigns more effectively.

<h5>Pandas is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.</h5>
